# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

Sure, I can provide you with a sample README file for an image classification project using PyTorch. Here's an example:

# Image Classification Project using PyTorch

This project is an image classification task using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to train a deep learning model to accurately classify each image into one of the 10 categories.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Download the CIFAR-10 dataset from [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and extract the files to the `data` directory.
4. Open the `train.py` file and adjust the hyperparameters as needed.
5. Run the `train.py` file to train the model.
6. Once the model is trained, run the `test.py` file to evaluate its performance on the test set.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

This script will train the model using the data in the `data/train` directory and save the trained model to the `models` directory.

### Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the model on the test set,run the following command:

```
python predict.py
```

This script will load the trained model from the `models` directory and evaluate its performance on the data in the `data/predict` directory.

### Adjusting Hyperparameters

The hyperparameters for the model can be adjusted in the `train.py` file. Some of the hyperparameters that can be adjusted include the learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, and optimizer.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 80% on the test set after training for 50 epochs. The loss and accuracy curves are plotted in the `results.png` file.

## Conclusion

In this project, we trained a deep learning model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. The model achieved good performance on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning for image classification tasks. This project can be expanded by using different datasets or experimenting with different deep learning architectures and hyperparameters.
